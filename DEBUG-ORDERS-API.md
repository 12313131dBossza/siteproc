# üîç Debug Orders API Issue

## Please Check Browser Console

Press **F12** and look for these messages:

1. **What is the response status now?**
   - Look for: `[fetchOrders] Response status: ???`
   - Is it still 401? Or 200? Or something else?

2. **What data is returned?**
   - Look for: `[fetchOrders] Success, data:`
   - Copy the entire object shown

3. **What is the orders list?**
   - Look for: `[fetchOrders] Orders list:`
   - Is it an empty array `[]` or does it have items?

## Alternative: Test API Directly

Open a new browser tab and go to:
```
https://siteproc1.vercel.app/api/orders
```

**Copy the entire response** and share it with me.

This will show us:
- If you're authenticated (should see data, not error)
- If the API is returning orders
- The exact format of the response

## Quick Network Tab Check

1. Press **F12**
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Refresh the page `/deliveries/new`
4. Look for the request to **orders** (or **api/orders**)
5. Click on it
6. Look at the **Response** tab
7. **Copy the response** and share it

This will tell us exactly what the API is returning!
