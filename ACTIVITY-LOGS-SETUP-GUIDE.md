## 🎉 Once Complete:

1. Go to: https://siteproc1.vercel.app/activity
2. You should see the Activity Log page with data!
3. Come back and tell me: **"Done!"** or **"I see activities!"**

---

## ⚠️ If You See Errors:

**"relation already exists"**
→ Table already exists! That's fine, script handles it.

**"permission denied"**
→ Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase project.

**"syntax error"**
→ Make sure you copied the ENTIRE file (all 379 lines).

## 💡 Quick Alternative:

If you prefer, I can create a simpler version that you can run via API!
Just say "use API instead" and I'll set it up.

**Ready?** Open Supabase and run the SQL! 🚀
