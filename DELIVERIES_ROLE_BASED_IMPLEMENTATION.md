| **Bookkeeper** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### API Authentication (`/api/order-deliveries`)
```typescript
// Authentication Check
const user = await getAuthenticatedUser()
if (!user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Authentication required' }, { status: 401 })
}

// Permission Validation  
if (!user.permissions.canCreate) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: `${user.role} role cannot create deliveries` 
  }, { status: 403 })
}
```

### Company-Scoped Data
- All deliveries are scoped to user's company
- Mock data generated with company context

- UI dynamically updates based on current permissions
- No page refresh needed for role changes
