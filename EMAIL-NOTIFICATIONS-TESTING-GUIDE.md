## Troubleshooting

### No Emails Arriving

**Check Environment Variables:**
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard or .env.local
RESEND_API_KEY=re_XPgiu8do_EkEzWDBmmjrLGLnEdQuYRpkS
EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
```

**Check Server Logs:**
- Look for "Failed to send [notification type] notification:" errors
- Check Resend dashboard at https://resend.com/emails for delivery status

**Common Issues:**
- API key not set â†’ Email functions return early
- Wrong from address â†’ 403 domain verification error
- Missing profile data â†’ Email may not have recipient info

### Email Arrives But Looks Wrong

**Check Template Data:**
- Verify all required fields are passed to email functions
- Check for undefined/null values in dashboard links
- Ensure company name is set in profile

**Formatting Issues:**
- Test in multiple email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Check plain text version if HTML rendering fails
- Verify CSS is inline (Resend handles this automatically)

### Links Don't Work

**Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`:**
```bash
# Should be set to your deployment URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

**Test Link Construction:**
- Order approval: `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/projects/${projectId}`
- Expenses: `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/expenses`
- Deliveries: `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/deliveries`
