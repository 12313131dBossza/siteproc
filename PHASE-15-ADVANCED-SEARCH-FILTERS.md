## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Database Changes

```sql
-- Saved filters table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS saved_filters (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    company_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    module TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (module IN ('orders', 'projects', 'deliveries', 'expenses', 'payments', 'products')),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    filters JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
    is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_saved_filters_user ON saved_filters(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_saved_filters_module ON saved_filters(module);
```

### API Endpoints

1. **GET /api/search** - Global search
2. **GET /api/[module]?filters={...}** - Enhanced list endpoints with filter support
3. **POST /api/saved-filters** - Save filter
4. **GET /api/saved-filters** - List saved filters
5. **PATCH /api/saved-filters/[id]** - Update filter
6. **DELETE /api/saved-filters/[id]** - Delete filter
7. **GET /api/[module]/export** - Export filtered data

### React Components

```
src/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GlobalSearch.tsx          # Global search modal
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FilterPanel.tsx           # Reusable filter sidebar/panel
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FilterChip.tsx            # Individual filter tag
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QuickFilters.tsx          # Preset filter buttons
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SavedFiltersDropdown.tsx  # Saved filters menu
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SortHeader.tsx            # Sortable table header
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ExportButton.tsx          # Export dropdown button
```

### Hooks

```typescript
// src/hooks/useFilters.ts
export function useFilters(module: string) {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({})
  const [savedFilters, setSavedFilters] = useState([])
  
  const applyFilter = (key, value) => { ... }
  const removeFilter = (key) => { ... }
  const clearFilters = () => { ... }
  const saveFilter = (name) => { ... }
  const loadFilter = (id) => { ... }
  
  return { filters, applyFilter, removeFilter, clearFilters, savedFilters, saveFilter, loadFilter }
}

// src/hooks/useSort.ts
export function useSort(defaultSort: string) {
  const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState(defaultSort)
  const [sortOrder, setSortOrder] = useState<'asc' | 'desc'>('desc')
  
  const toggleSort = (field) => { ... }
  
  return { sortBy, sortOrder, toggleSort }
}
```
