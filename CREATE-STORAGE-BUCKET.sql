-- STORAGE PATH STRUCTURE
-- ============================================================================

-- Documents will be stored with this path structure:
-- documents/{company_id}/{category}/{filename}
-- 
-- Example:
-- documents/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/invoices/invoice-2024-001.pdf
-- documents/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/photos/site-photo-20240115.jpg
--
-- This ensures:
-- 1. Company isolation (RLS policies check first folder segment)
-- 2. Category organization
-- 3. Easy cleanup when deleting a company
-- 4. Efficient querying and filtering
