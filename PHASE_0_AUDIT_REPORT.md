## 🟡 Modules Needing Fixes

### 5. Orders (`/orders`)
**Status:** Working with Minor TypeScript Error 🟡

**Issue:**
```typescript
// Line 959 in src/app/orders/page.tsx
variant="outline"  // ❌ Not a valid variant
```

**Error:**
```
Type '"outline"' is not assignable to type '"ghost" | "primary" | "accent" | "danger"'
```

## 🟠 Modules Using Mock Data

### 6. Activity Log (`/activity`)
**Status:** Mock Data Only - Needs Real Integration 🟠

**Current State:**
- ⚠️ Uses hardcoded mock activities
- ⚠️ No database integration
- ⚠️ Stats are calculated from mock data only

**What's Working (Mock):**
- UI is complete and polished
- Activity types: delivery, expense, change-order, user, order, payment
- Filters by type, status, date range
- Beautiful activity timeline
- User attribution

**Required Work:**
- [ ] Create `activity_logs` database table
- [ ] Schema: id, type, action, title, description, user_id, metadata, timestamp
- [ ] Create API endpoints: GET /api/activity, POST /api/activity
- [ ] Hook into all CRUD operations:
  - Orders: create, approve, reject
  - Deliveries: create, status change
  - Expenses: create, approve, reject
  - Projects: create, update
  - Payments: process
- [ ] Update UI to fetch from API
- [ ] Implement real-time stats calculation

**Priority:** HIGH - Essential for audit trail and compliance

---

## 🔴 Modules Not Yet Verified

### 7. Payments (`/admin/payments`)
**Status:** Exists but Untested ❓

**Path:** `/admin/payments` (admin-only)

**Required Work:**
- [ ] Verify page loads correctly
- [ ] Test payment CRUD operations
- [ ] Verify vendor payment tracking
- [ ] Check payment status derivation (paid/pending/overdue)
- [ ] Test link to orders/suppliers
- [ ] Verify role-based access (admin only)

**Priority:** HIGH - Critical for financial tracking

---

### 8. Reports Module
**Status:** MISSING - Doesn't Exist 🔴

**Required:** Create from scratch

**Reports Needed:**
1. **Project Financial Report**
   - Budget vs Actual vs Variance
   - Order spending breakdown
   - Expense breakdown by category
   - Delivery status overview
   - CSV/PDF export

2. **Payment Summary Report**
   - Outstanding payments
   - Paid vs unpaid
   - Vendor breakdown
   - Aging report (overdue payments)
   - CSV export

3. **Delivery Summary Report**
   - Deliveries by status
   - On-time vs delayed
   - Delivery value totals
   - Driver performance
   - CSV export

**Priority:** HIGH - Essential for management decision-making
