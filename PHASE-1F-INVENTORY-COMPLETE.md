# Phase 1F: Inventory Tracking - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Generated:** October 8, 2025  
**Commit:** `77dd2aa` - Phase 1F: Complete Inventory Tracking System

---

## üéâ Overview

Phase 1F has been successfully implemented and deployed! Your Products/Toko module now has **full inventory management** with:
- ‚úÖ Real-time stock tracking
- ‚úÖ Automatic alerts for low stock
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail for all inventory movements
- ‚úÖ Supplier management
- ‚úÖ Reorder point notifications
- ‚úÖ Multi-type inventory adjustments

---

## üìä What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement

**New Tables Created:**

#### `inventory_transactions` Table
Tracks every inventory movement with complete audit trail:
- Transaction types: purchase, sale, adjustment, return, damaged, theft, count, transfer
- Quantity changes with before/after snapshots
- Cost tracking (unit cost & total cost)
- Reference linking to orders/deliveries
- User attribution for accountability
- Company segregation for multi-tenancy

#### `inventory_alerts` Table
System-generated alerts for inventory issues:
- Alert types: low_stock, out_of_stock, overstocked, reorder
- Severity levels: info, warning, critical
- Resolution tracking with timestamps
- Linked to specific products

**Enhanced `products` Table:**
Added 15+ new inventory tracking columns:
- `stock_quantity` - Current stock level
- `min_stock_level` - Minimum before low stock alert
- `max_stock_level` - Maximum capacity (optional)
- `reorder_point` - Stock level triggering reorder alert
- `reorder_quantity` - Suggested order amount
- `stock_status` - Auto-calculated: in_stock, low_stock, out_of_stock, discontinued
- `last_restock_date` - Last stock addition date
- `last_stock_count` - Last physical count
- `supplier_name`, `supplier_email`, `supplier_phone` - Supplier contact info
- `lead_time_days` - Expected delivery time
- `rating` - Product rating (0-5 stars)
- `total_orders` - Lifetime order count
- `last_ordered` - Most recent order date

### 2. Automatic Triggers

#### `update_product_stock_status()`
Automatically updates `stock_status` when `stock_quantity` changes:
- `out_of_stock` when quantity ‚â§ 0
- `low_stock` when quantity ‚â§ min_stock_level
- `in_stock` when quantity > min_stock_level

#### `log_inventory_transaction()`
Automatically logs every stock change to `inventory_transactions` table:
- Captures before/after quantities
- Records transaction type based on quantity change
- Tracks user who made the change
- Maintains complete audit trail

#### `check_inventory_alerts()`
Automatically generates alerts when:
- Stock drops to or below min_stock_level (WARNING)
- Stock reaches zero (CRITICAL)
- Stock hits reorder_point (INFO)

### 3. API Routes

#### Products CRUD
- `GET /api/products` - List all products with filtering
  - Query params: `status`, `category`, `lowStock`
- `POST /api/products` - Create new product
- `GET /api/products/[id]` - Get single product
- `PUT /api/products/[id]` - Update product
- `DELETE /api/products/[id]` - Delete product

#### Inventory Management
- `POST /api/products/[id]/adjust` - Adjust inventory
  - Supports: purchase, sale, adjustment, return, damaged, theft, count
  - Tracks cost per transaction
  - Prevents negative stock
- `GET /api/products/[id]/history` - View transaction history
  - Returns last 100 transactions with user info

#### Alerts System
- `GET /api/inventory/alerts` - List alerts
  - Query param: `resolved` (true/false)
- `PUT /api/inventory/alerts/[id]/resolve` - Mark alert as resolved

### 4. Enhanced Toko UI

1. Select transaction type (Purchase, Sale, Adjustment, Return, Damaged, Theft, Stock Count)
2. Enter quantity change
3. Add unit cost (optional) for cost tracking
4. Add notes for audit trail
5. System prevents negative stock
6. Instant feedback with toast notifications

## üîß Installation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Copy and run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- From file: phase-1f-inventory-tracking.sql
-- Run the entire file - it will:
-- 1. Add inventory columns to products table
-- 2. Create inventory_transactions table
-- 3. Create inventory_alerts table
-- 4. Set up automatic triggers
-- 5. Configure RLS policies
-- 6. Create helpful views
```

**File location:** `phase-1f-inventory-tracking.sql` in project root

### Step 2: Verify Deployment

Visit your site: https://siteproc1.vercel.app/toko

You should see:
- Products page with real data (or empty if no products)
- Stats dashboard showing inventory metrics
- "Add Product" button working
- Product cards with "Adjust Stock" buttons

### Step 3: Test the System

1. **Add a Product:**
   - Click "Add Product"
   - Fill in name, category, price, stock quantity
   - Add supplier information
   - Set reorder points
   - Save

2. **Adjust Inventory:**
   - Click "Adjust Stock" on any product
   - Select "Purchase (Add Stock)"
   - Enter quantity: 50
   - Add notes: "Initial stock"
   - Submit

3. **Trigger Low Stock Alert:**
   - Edit a product
   - Set stock quantity below min_stock_level
   - Alert will be automatically generated

4. **View Transaction History:**
   - Use API: `GET /api/products/{id}/history`
   - See all inventory movements with timestamps

1. Manager logs in to Toko page
2. Sees alert: "3 products low on stock"
3. Reviews low stock products
4. Places orders with suppliers

**Delivery Arrives:**
1. Warehouse receives 100 units of Product A
2. Staff clicks "Adjust Stock" on Product A
3. Selects "Purchase (Add Stock)"
4. Enters 100 units, unit cost $15.50
5. Notes: "PO#12345 from Steel Supplier Co."
6. System logs transaction automatically
7. Stock status changes: Low Stock ‚Üí Good Stock
8. Alert auto-resolves

**Sale Made:**
1. Customer orders 50 units of Product B
2. System calls `/api/products/{id}/adjust`
3. Transaction type: "sale"
4. Quantity: -50 (removes from stock)
5. Reference: links to order ID
6. If stock drops below min level ‚Üí alert created

**Month End:**
1. Manager reviews transaction history
2. Analyzes cost trends
3. Identifies fast-moving products
