## Database Queries

### Project Financial Report
```sql
-- Get projects with budget
SELECT id, name, budget, status, created_at
FROM projects
WHERE company_id = $1
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Get approved/paid expenses per project
SELECT project_id, amount, status
FROM expenses
WHERE company_id = $1
  AND project_id IN (...)
  AND status IN ('approved', 'paid');
```

### Payment Summary Report
```sql
-- Get all expenses (payments)
SELECT id, vendor, category, amount, status, 
       created_at, approved_at, description
FROM expenses
WHERE company_id = $1
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Delivery Summary Report
```sql
-- Get all deliveries
SELECT id, order_id, delivery_date, status,
       driver_name, vehicle_number, total_amount,
       created_at, notes
FROM deliveries
WHERE company_id = $1
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Calculations & Business Logic

### Project Financial
- **Actual Expenses:** Sum of approved + paid expenses linked to project
- **Variance:** Budget - Actual Expenses
- **Variance %:** (Variance / Budget) Ã— 100
- **Budget Status:** "on-budget" if Variance â‰¥ 0, else "over-budget"

### Payment Summary
- **Paid:** Expenses with status 'paid' or 'approved'
- **Unpaid:** Expenses with status 'pending'
- **Overdue:** Pending expenses older than 30 days
- **Age:** Days since expense was created (now - created_at)
- **Category Totals:** Sum amounts grouped by category

### Delivery Summary
- **On-Time:** Delivered within 7 days of creation
- **On-Time %:** (On-Time Count / Total Delivered) Ã— 100
- **Delayed:** Pending deliveries older than 7 days
- **Age:** Days since delivery was created (now - created_at)
- **Driver Totals:** Sum amounts grouped by driver

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… API Tests
- [x] GET /api/reports/projects returns data
- [x] GET /api/reports/payments returns data
- [x] GET /api/reports/deliveries returns data
- [x] All endpoints require authentication
- [x] All endpoints filter by company_id (multi-tenant)
- [x] Summary stats calculated correctly

### ðŸ”² Integration Tests (To Do)
- [ ] Create project with budget
- [ ] Submit and approve expenses
- [ ] Verify Project Financial Report shows correct variance
- [ ] Create expenses with different statuses
- [ ] Verify Payment Summary Report categorizes correctly
- [ ] Create deliveries with different statuses
- [ ] Verify Delivery Summary Report shows on-time percentage
- [ ] Test CSV export for all 3 reports
- [ ] Verify downloaded CSV files have correct format
- [ ] Test tab navigation
- [ ] Test loading states
- [ ] Test with empty data (no projects/payments/deliveries)

### ðŸ”² UI Tests (To Do)
- [ ] Reports page loads without errors
- [ ] Tab navigation works
- [ ] Summary cards display correct numbers
- [ ] Data tables render properly
- [ ] Status badges show correct colors
- [ ] Variance shows green/red correctly
- [ ] Overdue/delayed flags appear correctly
- [ ] Currency formatting works
- [ ] Date formatting works
- [ ] Export button downloads CSV
- [ ] CSV contains correct data
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database
- Projects query: O(n) for projects, O(m) for expenses
- Payments query: O(n) single table query
- Deliveries query: O(n) single table query
- All queries filtered by company_id (indexed)
- All queries ordered by created_at (indexed)

### Frontend
- Tab-based loading (only fetch active tab data)
- Loading states prevent multiple requests
- CSV generation done client-side (no server load)
- Data cached until tab switch
- Efficient rendering with React keys

### Optimization Opportunities
- Add pagination for large datasets (> 100 records)
- Add date range filters
- Add search/filter functionality
- Cache report data with SWR or React Query
- Add background refresh
- Add real-time updates via WebSockets
