# How to Find Your Sentry Organization Slug

## ‚ùå Current Problem

Sentry build keeps failing with:
```
error: Project not found. Ensure that you configured the correct project and organization.
```

This is because `SENTRY_ORG` in Vercel is set to the wrong value.

## üîç How to Find the Correct Organization Slug

### Method 1: From Sentry Settings (Easiest)

1. **Go to:** https://sentry.io/settings/
2. **You'll see a page with organization settings**
3. **Look for:** "Organization Slug" field
4. **Copy the value** - It will be something like:
   - `sentry` (default)
   - `your-company-name`
   - `slug`
   - `my-org`
   - Some other text identifier

**Screenshot what you see and share it!**

### Method 2: From the URL

1. Go to https://sentry.io
2. Look at the URL in your browser
3. It will be: `https://sentry.io/organizations/YOUR-ORG-SLUG/`
4. Copy `YOUR-ORG-SLUG` from the URL

Example URLs:
- `https://sentry.io/organizations/acme/` ‚Üí Org slug is `acme`
- `https://sentry.io/organizations/my-company/` ‚Üí Org slug is `my-company`
- `https://sentry.io/organizations/slug/` ‚Üí Org slug is `slug`

### Method 3: From Project Settings

1. Go to: https://sentry.io/settings/projects/
2. Click on your project: `javascript-nextjs`
3. Look at the URL: `https://sentry.io/settings/YOUR-ORG-SLUG/projects/javascript-nextjs/`
4. Copy `YOUR-ORG-SLUG` from the URL

## ‚úÖ Once You Find It:

### Update Vercel Environment Variable

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click on:** SiteProc project
3. **Go to:** Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. **Find:** `SENTRY_ORG`
5. **Click:** Edit (pencil icon)
6. **Replace** `12` or whatever value is there
7. **With:** Your actual organization slug (e.g., `acme`, `sentry`, `slug`)
8. **Click:** Save

### Tell Me the Value

Once you find it, tell me:
- "The org slug is: `[your-value-here]`"

And I'll:
1. Re-enable Sentry in the code
2. Push the changes
3. Redeploy successfully! ‚úÖ

## üö® Common Mistakes

‚ùå **Wrong:** Using the organization ID number (e.g., `451024249166236`)  
‚úÖ **Correct:** Using the organization slug text (e.g., `my-company`)

‚ùå **Wrong:** Using `12` (this is not a valid slug)  
‚úÖ **Correct:** Using the actual text identifier from settings

‚ùå **Wrong:** Using your email or username  
‚úÖ **Correct:** Using the organization slug from Sentry settings

## ü§î Still Can't Find It?

If you're still stuck:

1. **Take a screenshot** of https://sentry.io/settings/
2. **Take a screenshot** of your browser URL bar when on Sentry
3. **Share both screenshots**

I'll tell you exactly what the org slug is! üéØ

## üéØ Alternative: Skip Sentry for Now

If you want to move forward without Sentry:

**Option A:** Keep Sentry disabled and move to Phase 2.2 (Email Notifications)  
**Option B:** Use Vercel's built-in error logging instead  
**Option C:** Come back to Sentry later

Your app works perfectly without Sentry - it's just nice to have for production error tracking!
