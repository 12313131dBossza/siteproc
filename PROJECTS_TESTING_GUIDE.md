üéØ PROJECTS MODULE TESTING GUIDE
================================

SETUP: First, let's get some real data to work with...

1Ô∏è‚É£ GET SAMPLE DATA FOR TESTING
==============================

Run these queries in your Supabase SQL editor to get test data:

-- Get available orders for testing
SELECT id, title, status, company_id, project_id, total_estimated, qty, unit_price 
FROM orders 
WHERE company_id = (SELECT company_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) 
LIMIT 5;

-- Get available expenses for testing  
SELECT id, description, amount, status, company_id, project_id
FROM expenses 
WHERE company_id = (SELECT company_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())
LIMIT 5;

-- Get available deliveries for testing
SELECT id, status, company_id, project_id
FROM deliveries 
WHERE company_id = (SELECT company_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())
LIMIT 5;

-- Get existing projects
SELECT id, name, code, budget, status, company_id
FROM projects 
WHERE company_id = (SELECT company_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

2Ô∏è‚É£ TEST PROJECT ‚Üí ORDERS ASSIGNMENT
===================================

Step 1: Navigate to a project detail page
‚Ä¢ URL: /projects/[project-id]
‚Ä¢ Note the current "# Orders" count in KPIs

Step 2: Go to "Orders" tab
‚Ä¢ Paste order IDs (from query above) into text area
‚Ä¢ Example: "order-123, order-456"
‚Ä¢ Click "Assign to Project"

Step 3: Verify results
‚úÖ Orders appear in project's Orders tab
‚úÖ "# Orders" count increases in Overview
‚úÖ No errors in browser console

Step 4: Test reassignment
‚Ä¢ Go to different project
‚Ä¢ Assign same orders to new project
‚úÖ Orders move from old project to new project
‚úÖ Old project's count decreases
‚úÖ New project's count increases

Step 5: Test invalid IDs
‚Ä¢ Try assigning "invalid-order-999"
‚úÖ Should show error message
‚úÖ Should NOT break the interface

3Ô∏è‚É£ TEST PROJECT ‚Üí EXPENSES ASSIGNMENT
====================================

Step 1: Note current financial KPIs
‚Ä¢ Budget: $X.XX
‚Ä¢ Actual (Expenses): $Y.YY  
‚Ä¢ Variance: $Z.ZZ

Step 2: Go to "Expenses" tab
‚Ä¢ Assign expenses with known amounts
‚Ä¢ Example: expense with $500.00 amount

Step 3: Verify calculations
‚úÖ "Actual (Expenses)" increases by expense amount
‚úÖ "Variance" = Budget - Actual Expenses
‚úÖ "# Expenses" count increases
‚úÖ Variance color: green if positive, red if negative

Step 4: Test edge cases
‚Ä¢ Assign expense with $0.00 amount
‚úÖ Should not break calculations
‚Ä¢ Assign very large expense (>$1,000,000)
‚úÖ Should handle large numbers properly

4Ô∏è‚É£ TEST PROJECT ‚Üí DELIVERIES ASSIGNMENT
======================================

Step 1: Note current "# Deliveries" count

Step 2: Go to "Deliveries" tab
‚Ä¢ Assign delivery IDs from your sample data

Step 3: Verify tracking
‚úÖ "# Deliveries" count increases
‚úÖ Deliveries appear in project view
‚úÖ Data links properly if connected to orders

5Ô∏è‚É£ TEST ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL
=================================

Admin Role Testing:
‚Ä¢ Should see "Assign to Project" buttons
‚Ä¢ Should be able to change project status
‚Ä¢ Should be able to assign/reassign items

Viewer/Member Role Testing:
‚Ä¢ Should NOT see assignment controls
‚Ä¢ Should be read-only access
‚Ä¢ Should show appropriate permission messages

Test this by:
1. Updating your profile role in database:
   UPDATE profiles SET role = 'viewer' WHERE id = auth.uid();
2. Refresh project page
3. Verify no assignment controls visible
4. Change back to admin: 
   UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = auth.uid();

6Ô∏è‚É£ TEST DATA INTEGRITY
======================

Cross-Company Protection:
‚Ä¢ Try assigning orders from different company
‚úÖ Should be rejected with error

Single Project Assignment:
‚Ä¢ Verify items can only belong to one project
‚Ä¢ Query: SELECT id, project_id FROM orders WHERE id = 'your-test-order';
‚úÖ project_id should only have one value

Closed Project Protection:
‚Ä¢ Set project status to "closed"
‚Ä¢ Try to assign new items
‚úÖ Should be rejected with "project_closed" error

7Ô∏è‚É£ TEST EDGE CASES
==================

Empty Assignments:
‚Ä¢ Submit empty text areas
‚úÖ Should handle gracefully (no error)

Malformed Input:
‚Ä¢ Try: "order1,,,order2,   ,order3"
‚úÖ Should parse correctly, ignore empty values

Large Data Sets:
‚Ä¢ Assign 50+ items at once
‚úÖ Should process without timeout

Invalid Project ID:
‚Ä¢ Try URL: /projects/invalid-project-123
‚úÖ Should show "project not found" error

8Ô∏è‚É£ INTEGRATION VERIFICATION
===========================

Global Data Consistency:
‚Ä¢ Go to /admin/orders page
‚úÖ Assigned orders should still appear
‚úÖ project_id column should be populated

‚Ä¢ Go to /admin/expenses page  
‚úÖ Assigned expenses should still appear
‚úÖ project_id column should be populated

‚Ä¢ Go to /admin/deliveries page
‚úÖ Assigned deliveries should still appear  
‚úÖ project_id column should be populated

Project Overview Updates:
‚Ä¢ Make assignments in one browser tab
‚Ä¢ Refresh project page in another tab
‚úÖ KPIs should reflect latest data
‚úÖ No caching issues

9Ô∏è‚É£ PERFORMANCE TESTING
======================

Load Testing:
‚Ä¢ Assign 100+ items to project
‚úÖ Page should load in <3 seconds
‚úÖ No browser freezing

Concurrent Access:
‚Ä¢ Multiple users editing same project
‚úÖ Data should remain consistent
‚úÖ No race condition issues

üîü FINAL VALIDATION QUERIES
===========================

Run these in Supabase to verify data integrity:

-- Verify no orphaned assignments
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_orders
FROM orders 
WHERE project_id IS NOT NULL 
AND project_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM projects);

-- Verify variance calculations
SELECT 
  p.name,
  p.budget,
  COALESCE(SUM(e.amount), 0) as actual_expenses,
  p.budget - COALESCE(SUM(e.amount), 0) as calculated_variance
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN expenses e ON e.project_id = p.id AND e.status = 'approved'
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.budget;

-- Verify counts match
SELECT 
  p.name,
  COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
  COUNT(e.id) as expense_count,
  COUNT(d.id) as delivery_count
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.project_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN expenses e ON e.project_id = p.id  
LEFT JOIN deliveries d ON d.project_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name;
