-- IMPORTANT: Look at the results above and tell me:
-- 1. Which table has rows? (row_count > 0)
-- 2. Do you see your test order "123213 (5 units @ $5)" in either table?
-- 
-- This will tell us if we need to:
-- Option A: Migrate data from purchase_orders to orders
-- Option B: Change the API back to use purchase_orders
