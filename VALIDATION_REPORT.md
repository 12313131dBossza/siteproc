## 🎯 NEXT STEPS FOR AGENT

To continue validation, I recommend:

1. **Start Development Server** - `npm run dev` and test each page manually
2. **Check Supabase Console** - Verify all tables, RLS policies, and data
3. **Run Playwright Tests** - `npm run e2e` to check critical flows
4. **Deploy to Vercel** - Test production environment
5. **Monitor Sentry** - Check for runtime errors (Sentry integration detected)
