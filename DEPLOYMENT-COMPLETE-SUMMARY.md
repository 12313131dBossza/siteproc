**Total Deployments:** 8 successful builds

---

## üêõ Bugs Fixed (6/6 Complete)

### 1. ‚úÖ Order Approval - FIXED
**Issue:** "Order not found" errors when approving orders  
**Root Cause:** API querying `orders` table instead of `purchase_orders`  
**Solution:**  
- Changed 8 query locations from `orders` to `purchase_orders` table
- Removed invalid `creator:profiles!created_by` join
- Fixed foreign key relationships

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` (3 queries)
- `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` (4 queries)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Project Dropdown Loading - FIXED
**Issue:** Project dropdowns not populating in expenses and deliveries forms  
**Root Cause:** API response format mismatch - `{success: true, data: []}` vs `[]`  
**Solution:**  
- Fixed data extraction to handle `json.data || json || []` pattern
- Added comprehensive error handling

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/expenses/page.tsx` (line 110-113)
- `src/components/RecordDeliveryForm.tsx` (line 74)

---

### 3. ‚úÖ View Delivery Details - FIXED
**Issue:** View Details button did nothing

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/deliveries/page.tsx` (100+ lines added)

### 4. ‚úÖ POD (Proof of Delivery) Upload - FIXED
**Issue:** "supabaseKey is required" error when uploading POD  
**Root Cause:** 
1. Environment variable name mismatch (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` vs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE`)
2. Deprecated auth helper functions
3. Bucket name mismatch

**Solution:**  
- Fixed env var from `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE`
- Rewrote endpoint to use `getCurrentUserProfile()` pattern
- Changed bucket from `'proofs'` to `'delivery-proofs'`
- Returns public URLs instead of signed URLs
- Added image preview in View Details modal
- Added "POD Uploaded" badge in delivery list

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/deliveries/[id]/upload-proof/route.ts` (complete rewrite, 104 lines)

**Deployment #7 specifically fixed this!**
