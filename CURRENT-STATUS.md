## 📊 COMPLETION ESTIMATE

Based on what's already done:

**Core Features (Orders×Deliveries Sync)**: 90% complete
- ✅ Frontend built
- ✅ API created
- ⏳ Migration needs to be applied (5 min)
- ⏳ Testing needed (10 min)

**Remaining Work**:
- Deliveries status flow improvements: 2-3 hours
- Payments module: 3-4 hours
- Activity log: 2 hours
- Reports enhancements: 2-3 hours
- UI polish: 1-2 hours

**Total**: ~12-15 hours of focused work

**But we can get to 80% production-ready in next 2-3 hours** by:
1. Applying migration ✓
2. Testing Orders×Deliveries sync ✓
3. Completing Deliveries status flow ✓
4. Basic Payments module ✓

   - Need to verify CRUD works
   - Check if it updates project actuals

2. **Products Catalog**
   - Page exists at `/products`
   - Need to verify it's complete
   - Check integration with orders

3. **Reports**
   - Page exists at `/admin/reports`
   - Need to see what's implemented
   - May need enhancements
