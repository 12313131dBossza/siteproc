## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Activity Log Page Not Displaying Data
**Problem:** Activity Log page showed "No activities found" despite data existing in database.

**Root Cause:** API response format mismatch
- API returned: `{ ok: true, data: [...], stats: {...} }`
- Page expected: `{ activities: [...], stats: {...} }`

**Solution:** 
- Changed API response key from `data` to `activities` in `/api/activity/route.ts`
- Added 'client', 'contractor', 'bid' to validTypes array

**Result:** ✅ Activity Log page now displays all activities correctly

---

### Issue #2: Phase 2 Actions Not Appearing in Activity Log
**Problem:** Creating/updating/deleting clients, contractors, and bids did not log to activity_logs table.

**Root Cause:** Missing `logActivity()` calls in Phase 2 API routes

**Solution:** Added activity logging to all Phase 2 endpoints:
- **Clients API**: 3 endpoints (create, update, delete)
- **Contractors API**: 3 endpoints (create, update, delete)
- **Bids API**: 5 endpoints (create, update, delete, approve, reject)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/clients/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/clients/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/contractors/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/contractors/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/bids/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/bids/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/bids/[id]/approve/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/bids/[id]/reject/route.ts`

**Result:** ✅ All Phase 2 actions now appear in Activity Log with proper metadata

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### Activity Log Enum Update
```sql
-- Added new activity types for Phase 2
ALTER TYPE activity_type ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'client';

## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **No bulk operations** - Currently only single record CRUD operations
2. **No import/export** - Clients and contractors cannot be imported from CSV
3. **No bid comparison** - No side-by-side bid comparison view
4. **No contractor ratings** - No rating/review system for contractors

*These are planned for future phases.*
