-- ðŸŽ¯ SIMPLEST FIX: Just use existing data or show what's missing
-- Run this to diagnose and fix your orders issue

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 1: Check what you have
-- ==========================================
SELECT '=== DIAGNOSTIC INFO ===' as step;

-- Your profile
SELECT

-- Your company
SELECT

-- Your projects
SELECT

  p.id,
  p.name,
  p.status

WHERE p.company_id = (SELECT company_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid());

-- ==========================================
-- STEP 2: If you have a project, create order
-- ONLY RUN THIS IF STEP 1 SHOWS YOU HAVE PROJECTS
-- ==========================================

-- Uncomment and run this if you saw projects in Step 1:
