## How to Test

### Quick Test (Use the Test Page)

2. Enter your email address
3. Click template buttons to test each notification type
4. Check your inbox for emails

### Integration Tests (Real Workflows)

#### Test Order Approval/Rejection:
1. Create order as regular user
2. Log in as admin
3. Approve or reject the order
4. Check order creator's email for notification

#### Test Expense Submission:
1. Log in as regular user (non-admin)
2. Go to Expenses page
3. Submit new expense
4. Check admin email for notification

#### Test Delivery Confirmation:

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Emails arrive within 30 seconds

- ‚úÖ Plain text fallback is readable
- ‚úÖ Dashboard links work and navigate to correct pages
- ‚úÖ All details (amounts, names, dates) are accurate

## Error Handling

All email integrations follow best practices:
- ‚úÖ Wrapped in try-catch blocks
- ‚úÖ Log errors to console without crashing
- ‚úÖ Don't fail the main operation if email fails
- ‚úÖ Continue processing even if email service is down

Example pattern:
```typescript
try {
  const adminEmails = await getCompanyAdminEmails(companyId)
  if (adminEmails.length > 0) {
    await sendNotification({ /* params */ })
  }
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error('Failed to send notification:', emailError)
  // Don't fail the request if email fails
}
```

## Configuration

All notifications use the same email configuration:
- **Provider**: Resend
- **API Key**: `RESEND_API_KEY` (set in Vercel environment)
- **From Address**: `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's verified domain)
- **Rate Limits**: 100 emails/day, 3,000/month (free tier)

## Production Ready Features

‚úÖ **Automatic Delivery**: All notifications send automatically when triggered  
‚úÖ **No User Action Required**: Works out of the box after deployment  
‚úÖ **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working even if email fails  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Logging**: All email operations logged for debugging  
‚úÖ **Professional Templates**: HTML + plain text with company branding
