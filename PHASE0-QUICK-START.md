## 🚀 WHAT TO DO NOW

### Option 1: Manual Testing (Recommended) 👈
**Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Purpose:** Find any bugs before building new features

**Steps:**
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Open `PHASE0-MANUAL-AUDIT-CHECKLIST.md`
3. Go through each page systematically:
   - Dashboard (/dashboard)
   - Projects (/projects)
   - Orders (/orders)
   - Deliveries (/deliveries)
   - Expenses (/expenses)
   - Payments (/payments)
   - Products (/products)
   - Reports (/reports)
   - Activity (/activity)
   - Clients (/clients)
   - Contractors (/contractors)
   - Bids (/bids)
   - Companies (/co)
   - Change Orders (/change-orders)
   - Settings (/settings)
   - Notifications (/notifications)

4. Check for:
   - ✅ Page loads
   - ✅ Data displays
   - ✅ No console errors
   - ✅ Forms work
   - ✅ Buttons work

5. Mark findings in the checklist

### Option 2: Skip to Phase 1 (Quick Start)
**Time:** 3-5 hours  
**Risk:** May have hidden bugs

**We would build:**
- Activity Log (auto-tracking)
- Delivery status flow
- Manual payment system
- PDF export for reports

### Option 3: Quick Smoke Test (5 minutes)
**Purpose:** Just verify app works at all

1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Check dashboard loads
3. Click through 3-4 pages
4. If everything loads → proceed to Phase 1
5. If errors → do full manual testing

**A. Full Manual Testing** ← Most thorough, finds all bugs  
   _"Let's make sure everything works before building more"_

**B. Quick Smoke Test** ← Fastest, might miss some issues  
   _"Just check if the app basically works"_

**C. Skip to Phase 1** ← Fastest development, higher risk
