# Sentry Deployment Error - Troubleshooting

## ‚ùå Error Message:
```
Project not found. Ensure that you configured the correct project and organization.
```

## üîç Root Cause:
The `SENTRY_ORG` or `SENTRY_PROJECT` environment variables don't match your actual Sentry configuration.

## ‚úÖ Solution Steps:

### 1. Find Your Organization Slug

**Option A: From Sentry URL**
- Go to https://sentry.io
- Click on your organization
- Look at the URL: `https://sentry.io/organizations/YOUR-ORG-SLUG/`
- Copy `YOUR-ORG-SLUG` (NOT the number "12")

**Option B: From Organization Settings**
- Go to https://sentry.io/settings/
- Click on your organization name
- Go to **General Settings**
- Find "Organization Slug" (e.g., `my-company`, `acme-corp`, etc.)

### 2. Find Your Project Slug

**From your screenshot, you saw:**
```
Slug: javascript-nextjs
```

But we need to verify this is correct:

1. Go to https://sentry.io/settings/projects/
2. Click on your project (`javascript-nextjs`)
3. Go to **Settings ‚Üí General**
4. Confirm the **exact** project slug

### 3. Verify in Vercel

Your current Vercel environment variables should be:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://dfca40f1c140e1372121cb60434d9db5@o451024249166236.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510242500182016
SENTRY_ORG=????? <-- THIS NEEDS TO BE THE ORG SLUG (not "12")
SENTRY_PROJECT=javascript-nextjs
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=sntrys_XXXXX...
```

### 4. Common Mistakes

‚ùå **Wrong:** `SENTRY_ORG=12`  
‚úÖ **Correct:** `SENTRY_ORG=your-org-slug` (e.g., `my-company`)

‚ùå **Wrong:** Using organization ID number  
‚úÖ **Correct:** Using organization slug (name)

### 5. How to Fix

1. **Find your organization slug** from https://sentry.io/settings/
2. **Update Vercel environment variables:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com ‚Üí SiteProc ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Edit `SENTRY_ORG` with the correct slug
   - Save changes
3. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to Deployments
   - Click **Redeploy**

## üö´ Alternative: Disable Sentry During Build (Temporary)

If you want to deploy now and configure Sentry later, you can temporarily disable source map uploading:

**In `next.config.ts`:**

Change line ~45 from:
```typescript
export default withSentryConfig(
  nextConfig,
  {
    silent: true, // Change to false to see errors
    org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
    project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
  },
```

To:
```typescript
export default withSentryConfig(
  nextConfig,
  {
    silent: true,
    org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
    project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
    disableServerWebpackPlugin: true, // Disable during build
    disableClientWebpackPlugin: true, // Disable during build
  },
```

This will allow your app to deploy, but won't upload source maps to Sentry (error tracking will still work, but stack traces won't be as readable).

## üéØ Recommended Fix

**Don't disable Sentry!** Just fix the `SENTRY_ORG` value:

1. Go to https://sentry.io/settings/
2. Find your **Organization Slug** (it's NOT "12")
3. Update `SENTRY_ORG` in Vercel with the correct slug
4. Redeploy
