# 🎯 PROJECTS MODULE - COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Based on your exact requirements, here's the systematic testing plan:

## 📋 PRE-TESTING SETUP

### Step 1: Create Test Data
1. Run the `comprehensive-project-validation.sql` setup section in Supabase
2. Note the IDs returned for orders, expenses, and deliveries
3. Have your project ID ready: `96abb85f-5920-4ce9-9966-90411a660aac`

### Step 2: Access Your Project
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/projects/96abb85f-5920-4ce9-9966-90411a660aac`
2. Note initial KPI values:
   - Budget: $2.00
   - Actual (Expenses): $0.00 (should be)
   - Variance: $2.00 (should be)
   - # Orders: 0
   - # Expenses: 0 
   - # Deliveries: 0

---

## 🔗 TEST 1: LINKING ORDERS, EXPENSES, DELIVERIES TO PROJECTS

### ✅ Test 1A: Expense Assignment ($1,200 Material Supply)

**Action Steps:**
1. Go to **Expenses** tab in your project
2. Paste the expense ID from your test data (the $1,200 one)
3. Click "Assign to Project"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Expense appears in project's Expenses tab
- ✅ "Actual (Expenses)" increases by $1,200
- ✅ "Variance" decreases by $1,200 (becomes negative if over budget)
- ✅ "# Expenses" count increases by 1

**Validation:**
- Go to global Expenses page (`/admin/expenses`)
- ✅ The $1,200 expense should show "linked to Project [name]"
- ✅ It should NOT appear in "unassigned" lists

### ✅ Test 1B: Order Assignment

**Action Steps:**
1. Go to **Orders** tab in your project
2. Paste 2-3 order IDs from your test data
3. Click "Assign to Project"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Orders appear in project's Orders tab
- ✅ "# Orders" count increases
- ✅ No change to financial KPIs (orders don't affect budget/actual)

### ✅ Test 1C: Delivery Assignment

**Action Steps:**
1. Go to **Deliveries** tab in your project
2. Paste delivery IDs from your test data
3. Click "Assign to Project"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Deliveries appear in project's Deliveries tab
- ✅ "# Deliveries" count increases
- ✅ No change to financial KPIs

---

## 📊 TEST 2: OVERVIEW AUTO-UPDATES (Budget, Actual, Variance)

### ✅ Test 2A: Budget vs Actual Calculation

**Setup:**
- Assign multiple expenses with different statuses:
  - $1,200 (approved) - should count
  - $850.50 (approved) - should count  
  - $300.75 (pending) - should NOT count
  - $150.00 (rejected) - should NOT count

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Budget: $2.00 (unchanged)
- ✅ Actual (Expenses): $2,050.50 ($1,200 + $850.50, only approved)
- ✅ Variance: -$2,048.50 (over budget, should be red)
- ✅ Only approved expenses count toward actual

### ✅ Test 2B: Real-time Updates

**Action Steps:**
1. Open project in one browser tab
2. In another tab, change an expense status from pending to approved
3. Refresh the project page

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ KPIs update to reflect new approved expense
- ✅ Variance calculation updates correctly

### ✅ Test 2C: Count Accuracy

**Validation:**
- ✅ # Orders = exact count of assigned orders
- ✅ # Expenses = exact count of assigned expenses (all statuses)
- ✅ # Deliveries = exact count of assigned deliveries

---

## 🔐 TEST 3: ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL

### ✅ Test 3A: Admin Role Permissions

**With Admin Role:**
- ✅ Can see "Assign to Project" buttons in all tabs
- ✅ Can change project status dropdown
- ✅ Can assign/reassign orders, expenses, deliveries
- ✅ Can edit project budget (if UI allows)

### ✅ Test 3B: Viewer/Member Role Permissions

**Change your role to viewer:**
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'viewer' WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

**With Viewer Role:**
- ✅ Can see project details and KPIs
- ✅ CANNOT see "Assign to Project" buttons
- ✅ CANNOT change project status
- ✅ Gets read-only access with appropriate messaging

**Restore admin role after testing:**
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

---

## ⚠️ TEST 4: EDGE CASES

### ✅ Test 4A: Unassigned Items

**Check unassigned behavior:**
- ✅ Create new expense without assigning to project
- ✅ It stays in "unassigned" state
- ✅ Does NOT affect any project totals
- ✅ Appears in global lists but not project lists

### ✅ Test 4B: Double Assignment Prevention

**Test cross-project assignment:**
1. Create second project (or use different project ID)
2. Try to assign same expense to multiple projects

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ System should prevent double assignment
- ✅ OR clearly move item from old project to new project
- ✅ No item should belong to multiple projects simultaneously

### ✅ Test 4C: Status-Based Calculations

**Test with different expense statuses:**
- ✅ Pending expenses: Don't count toward "Actual"
- ✅ Approved expenses: Count toward "Actual"
- ✅ Rejected expenses: Don't count toward "Actual"
- ✅ Variance always = Budget - Actual(approved only)

### ✅ Test 4D: Item Deletion Impact

**Test deletion behavior:**
1. Delete an assigned expense from database
2. Refresh project page

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Project totals auto-refresh
- ✅ Counts decrease appropriately
- ✅ No broken references or errors
