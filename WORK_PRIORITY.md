## 🚀 Quick Answer: What to Work On Next

Based on the validation analysis, here's your priority order:

---

## 🔴 **THIS WEEK (Critical - 11-16 hours)**

### **1. Deploy to Vercel & Test** ⏱️ 2-3 hours
```powershell
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel  # Creates preview deployment
```

**Test these workflows:**
- ✅ Sign up/login
- ✅ Create delivery → change status → upload proof
- ✅ Create order → link to project
- ✅ Request payment → approve
- ✅ Generate report → export CSV
- ✅ Generate PO PDF

**Fix any deployment errors before moving forward.**

### **2. Build Activity Log Viewer** ⏱️ 4-6 hours
**WHY:** Database ready, no UI to see audit trails  
**IMPACT:** High - needed for compliance & debugging

**Create:**
- `src/app/activity/page.tsx`
- `src/components/ActivityLogTable.tsx`

**Features:**
- Display all activity_logs with Eastern Time timestamps
- Filter by: date range, user, action type, entity
- Search by entity_id
- Pagination (50-100 per page)

// Filters: Date picker, User dropdown, Action type
// Actions: View details modal, Export CSV
```
