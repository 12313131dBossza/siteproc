-- üîÑ REFRESH POSTGREST SCHEMA CACHE
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to reload the API schema cache
-- This fixes: "Could not find table in schema cache" errors

-- ==============================================
-- STEP 1: Notify PostgREST to reload schema
-- ==============================================

-- This triggers PostgREST to reload its schema cache
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';

-- ==============================================
-- STEP 2: Verify actual database structure
-- ==============================================

-- Check purchase_orders table exists

-- STEP 4: Reload schema cache again
